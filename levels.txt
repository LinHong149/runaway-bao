Can he sneak a dumpling without waking her up?|Get a dumpling from the kitchen and return to bed without waking Mom.

Level 4: Lost and Found|Bao got out. He left for the sleepover. But now the world feels too big. The streets are dark. He feels alone. And in his heart, he knows where he really wants to be — home.|Find your way back home before your confidence runs out.
