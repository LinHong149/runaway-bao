Level 1: Midnight Snack|It's past midnight. The moonlight spills through the window. Bao's tummy rumbles... just one little snack. But Mom's a light sleeper, and the kitchen is full of noisy traps. Can he sneak a dumpling without waking her up?|Get a dumpling from the kitchen and return to bed without waking Mom.
Level 2: Slipper Storm|The next morning, Mom found the empty plate. Bao's report card wasn't good either. She meets him with silence — and then, the slipper flies. It's chaos. But maybe... it's her way of showing she still cares.|Avoid all projectiles and reach Bao's room safely.
Level 3: Lost and Found|After the slipper incident, Bao decided to run away. But now the world feels too big. The streets are dark. He feels alone. And in his heart, he knows where he really wants to be — home.|Find your way back home before your confidence runs out.
